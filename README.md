# Prasanna Shakya

Computer Engineering student at Himalaya College of Engineering, Tribhuvan University.  
Focused on Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision, with an interest in building practical, data-driven systems from solid theoretical foundations.

I enjoy working across the full ML workflow — data preparation, model design, experimentation, and evaluation — with an emphasis on clarity, reproducibility, and real-world relevance.
