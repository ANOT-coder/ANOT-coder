# About Me

I am a Computer Engineering student at Himalaya College of Engineering, Tribhuvan University, with a focused interest in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, particularly in Computer Vision and applied machine learning systems. I am driven by the challenge of transforming theoretical concepts into practical, data-driven solutions that solve real-world problems.

I have hands-on experience working with Python, machine learning, and deep learning frameworks, with an emphasis on building, training, and evaluating models. I am comfortable working with both structured and unstructured data and value clean experimentation, reproducibility, and clarity in implementation.

My project experience includes a CNN-based Emotional Intelligence Prediction system and multiple computer vision applications developed using OpenCV. In addition, I have built a Digital Financial Advisor for basic financial insights and a Diet Recommendation system based on user data, focusing on practical machine learning–driven decision support.
